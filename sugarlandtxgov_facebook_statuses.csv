139809379375627_1728859400470609, Technology Keeps Sugar Land Safe MovingThe city of Sugar Land?s use of camera technology has ensured that the city is safer than ever before; however not all cameras serve the same purpose. We utilize several types of cameras to catch criminals keep our intersections safe and improve mobility. Can you tell the difference?? Red light cameras are currently utilized at six intersections. The implementation of red light cameras in Sugar Land resulted in a 58 percent reduction in accidents at targeted intersections.  By state law red light revenue is split between the state and the city; the city?s share must be used to fund traffic enforcement programs such as Safe Light Sugar Land. Read more at www.sugarlandtx.gov/safelight.? Our Crime Prevention Camera Program utilizes license plate recognition cameras at major entrances and exits to city mostly north of U.S. Highway 90A.  They will be considered for expansion throughout other areas of the city as funding becomes available. They have long been an effective crime-fighting tool for Sugar Land neighborhoods and businesses and they also serve as a deterrent. We?ve captured a number of criminals using this technology.  Read more at www.sugarlandtx.gov/crimecameras. ? The traffic detection and traffic monitoring cameras seen by motorists at intersections throughout our city are part of Intelligent Transportation Systems. They both serve a key role to managing traffic from the city?s state-of-the-art Traffic Management Center (TMC). State law prohibits the use of the traffic cameras for monitoring criminal activity. The traffic detection cameras are primarily used to call the green indication for the approach in which they are facing. The real-time traffic cameras are used to observe traffic in real time from the TMC. They assist operators in viewing traffic conditions so they can make adjustments if needed or troubleshoot reported concerns. The real-time cameras also supply images to our ITS.sugarlandtx.gov website that allows users to view traffic conditions in real-time. These cameras do not record or store video; however they?re an important tool to keep traffic moving and address what continually ranks as one of our residents? top concerns ? mobility.

All of Sugar Land?s old trees and beautiful bodies of water make it the ideal location for a very active bird population. This is particularly the case this time of year when lots of baby birds are being hatched. We have several rookeries throughout the city including one for Black-crowned Night Herons on Edgewater Blvd. These moms and dads come back every year and start setting up their nests in Late March early April. Babies start hatching soon after that and go through July. The pictures below are of a fledgling a teenager and then an adult. Full adult plumage is not acquired until their third year.What to do if you find a baby bird: http://www.sugarlandtx.gov/DocumentCenter/View/36/I-Found-a-Baby-Bird, Petopia- City of Sugar Land Animal Services, photo, https://www.facebook.com/PetopiaSLTX/photos/a.330583044116565.1073741830.329165007591702/377514022756800/?type=3, 2018-05-25 09:59:15, 8, 1, 0, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
